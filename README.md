🏙️ Reconciliation Project 🚀
This project automates financial reconciliations by processing input CSV files stored in an AWS S3 bucket. The script is written in Python and leverages Apache Spark 3.0 for distributed data processing. The reconciliation process is triggered by running a shell script, and the results are saved back to S3.

🛠️ Configuration
The reconciliation process is configured using a reconciliation.yaml file located in the configs/ directory. This file specifies the input and output paths for CSV files, as well as other settings.

📂 Example configs/reconciliation.yaml
yaml
Copy
input:
  bucket: "your-input-s3-bucket"
  path: "input/reconciliation_files/"  # Path to input CSV files in S3

output:
  bucket: "your-output-s3-bucket"
  path: "output/reconciliation_results/"  # Path to save output results in S3

spark:
  app_name: "ReconciliationJob"
  master: "local[*]"  # Spark master URL
  log_level: "INFO"   # Logging level for Spark
🔑 Key Configuration Parameters
Section	Parameter	Description
Input	bucket	The S3 bucket where input CSV files are stored.
path	The folder path within the S3 bucket containing the input CSV files.
Output	bucket	The S3 bucket where reconciliation results will be saved.
path	The folder path within the S3 bucket to store the output results.
Spark	app_name	Name of the Spark application.
master	Spark master URL (e.g., local[*] for local mode).
log_level	Logging level for Spark (e.g., INFO, DEBUG).
🚀 Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8+: Required for running the reconciliation script.

Apache Spark 3.0: Ensure Spark is installed and properly configured.

AWS CLI: For interacting with AWS S3.

Git: For cloning and managing the repository.

🛠️ Setup
1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
2. Set Up Python Environment
Create a Python virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Configure AWS Credentials
Update the .env file with your AWS credentials and region:

env
Copy
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
AWS_REGION=your-region
S3_BUCKET=your-s3-bucket-name
4. Set Up Spark
Ensure Spark is installed and configured correctly. Set the SPARK_HOME environment variable:

bash
Copy
export SPARK_HOME=/path/to/spark
export PATH=$SPARK_HOME/bin:$PATH
🏃 Running the Reconciliation Job
1. Input CSV Files
Place your input CSV files in the specified S3 bucket. The script will automatically process these files.

2. Run the Script
Execute the reconciliation job using the provided shell script:

bash
Copy
./scripts/run_job.sh
3. Output
The processed reconciliation results will be saved back to the S3 bucket in the output/ directory.

🌐 Environment Variables
The .env file contains the following variables:

Variable	Description
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID	Your AWS access key ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY	Your AWS secret access key
AWS_REGION	AWS region where the S3 bucket is located
S3_BUCKET	Name of the S3 bucket for input/output files
🛠️ How It Works
Input: The script reads CSV files from the specified S3 bucket.

Processing: The reconciliation logic is executed using Apache Spark for efficient data processing.

Output: The results are saved back to the S3 bucket in the output/ directory.

🛠️ Dependencies
Python Libraries:

boto3: For interacting with AWS S3.

pyspark: For distributed data processing.

Spark: For large-scale data processing.

🛠️ Troubleshooting
AWS Credentials Error: Ensure the .env file is correctly configured with valid AWS credentials.

Spark Not Found: Verify that Spark is installed and the SPARK_HOME environment variable is set.

S3 Access Denied: Check if the AWS credentials have sufficient permissions to access the S3 bucket.
